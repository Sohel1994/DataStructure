C++ interview questions :- 

1)What are the data types in C++
permitive data type : char int short boolen etc.
derived data type : Array , pointers. 
enumuration data type : enum 
user defined : structure and class.

2)What are the class and Object in C++?
class is user defined data type which is collection of data members and member function.
data members are data variables and member functions are funtions performs operations on data variables.
and object is instance of class since class is user defined data type so oject is varible of a class.

3)What is the difference between structure and class?
In C++ structure and class are same the main difference is the members of structure are public by default 
while members of class privet by default.

4)What is operator overloading ?
This is very essintial element in C++ which we can modify defualt meaning of operators to perform operations
on user defined data type.
example : 
class complex{
  int r , i;
  public:
  complex( int a , int b):r{a},i{b}
  { 
     cout<<" this is initilization of memebers "<< r << " and " << i << " by parmeterized constructor"<<"\n";
  }
  
  complex ( )
  {
    cout<<"default constructor called"<<"\n";
  }
  
  complex operator +(complex c)
  {
     complex t;
	 t.i = i + c.i;
	 t.r = r + c.r;
	 return t;
  }
  
  void display()
  {
     cout<< r << "+" << i << "i" << "\n"; 
  }
};

int main (){
 
 complex a( 3 , 4 );
 complex b( 5 , 7 );
 complex c;
 c=a+b;
 c.display();
}

5)What is Polymorphisam in C++?
simple meaning is which has many forms, which can be defined as it works different in different situation. 
their are 2 types of polymorphism 
1)compile time : operator overloading and function overloading.
2)Run time : virtual function.

6)What is inheritance?
The properties and characterstics of one class is derived to form new class with its new features.
the new class called derived class or child class.

7) What is the constructor?
the constuctor is spacial member function of class which automatically gets invoked when object of class is get created.
the constuctor has no return type. 
defaul constructor
parameterised constuctor 
copy constructor

8)what is the virtual function?
 virtual function is the member function of class which is redifined in the derived class.
 when the function made virtual c++ determines which funtion is to be invoked at run time based on type of object pointed
 by base class pointer.
 
9)What is friend class and friend funtion?
the class or function which can access the privet memebers of a class where they are decleared as friend.
example:
class A
{
    int n;
	public:
	A()
   	{  n = 10;
	   cout<<" class A constructor called"<<"\n";
	}
    friend int fun ( A );
};

int fun (A a)
{
    return a.n += 10; 
}

int main ()
{
   A b;
   cout << " friend function called " << fun(b)<< "\n";
}

10)What is inline function?
the compiler places the copy of the code where the function is called at compile time.

11)What the reference ?
reference is like pointer, it is aliace name of already existing varible;
example:  
int x = 10;
int &ref = x; // reference variable 

12)What is the abstraction?
Is the processs of showing the essential details to the user and hiding backround details which are irrlevent to user.


13)Destructor overloding is possible?
NO not possible because destructor takes no arguments. so there is the only one way to destroy an object. 

14) call by value and call by reference?
  call by value : in function call we pass copy of the argument which does not affect the actual arguments.
  call by refernce : in function call we pass the address of the actual arguments which affect them.
example:
void fun ( int *p , int * q)
{
    *p = 20;
	*q = 30;
}

void fun2 ( int a , int b)
{s
    a = 40;
	b = 50;
}

int main (){

 int s, r;
 s=2;
 r=3;
//  fun( &s,&r);
fun2( s,r);
cout<< s << " "<< r << "\n";

}

15)What is the abstract Class?
the abstract class is class whose object can not be created it can be achived by defining atleast one pure virtual function in
to the class.

16) What is static member and static memeber function?
 When the variable decleared as static in class the space allocated for it is life time of the program.
 no matter how many object has been created for the class there is only one copy.
 static members can be access by class name and scope resolution operator.
 those are not initilize by constructor.
example:
class GfG 
{
public:
	// static member function
	static int i ;
	static void printMsg() 
	{ 
	cout << "Welcome to GfG!"; 
     i = 20;
	}
};
int GfG::i=10;
int main()
{
	cout<< GfG::i;
	GfG::printMsg();
	cout << "\n";
	cout<< GfG::i;
}

17) What is copy constructor?
 copy constructor is the member function of a class that initilizes the object using another object of same class.
example :
class A
{
 int x,y;
 public:
 A(){
  cout<<"class A constructor called"; 
 }
};
int main()
{
 A a;
 A b = a; // default copy constructor called;
}
